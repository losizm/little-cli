## Getting Started
To use **little-cli**, start by adding it to your project:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.github.losizm" %% "little-cli" % "0.1.0"
```

There's also a runtime dependency to [Apache Commons CLI](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-cli/index.html),
so you must add it to your project as well.

```scala
libraryDependencies += "commons-cli" % "commons-cli" % "1.4"
```
